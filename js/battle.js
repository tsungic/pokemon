    Deal with your "battle sequence" by:
        - Subtracting player attack damage from the CPU's health.
        - Record this action in your "battlelog" (tip: an array works well for the battlelog)
        - Subtracting CPU attack damage from the Player's health.
        - Record this action in your "battlelog"
        - Determining if there has been a win, loss, or draw.
        - Record the result in your "battlelog"
        - Save the updated game state (ie. player/cpu pokemon and health) to a cookie(s)

    - Use selectors to target and fill in the img, .name, and .health elements on battle.html
    - Display the .battlelog contents
    - If the battle is over, present the user with a button to go back to index.html to start a new round
      and also wipe the cookies. 
    - Otherwise, present the user with a button to refresh the page and complete the next battle sequence.
