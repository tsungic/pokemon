Ideas for extra features:

- Add more pokemon to the pokemon.js file
- Add a "Run Away" button
- Create a stylish healthbar
- Add CSS battle animations
- Record the total number of wins and losses

- Attack damage is randomly selected between a range of numbers ie. 10 - 15 damage. 
- Attack damage based on a hit/dam dice system ie. Hit 5 / Dam 3 would be 5 rolls of a 3 sided dice
- Add healing potions
- Use pokeballs to "catch" the Pokemon

- Allow the Player and CPU to choose between multiple attacks
- Incorporate different pokemon "types" ie. Grass is weak to Fire, Fire is weak to water, etc...
